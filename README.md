Complete design of a quadcopter using an Arduino Pro Mini for the quadcopter and an Arduino Uno for the controller. The quadcopter consists of two dual motor drivers modules and a radio module transmitting and receiving data through the SPI protocol. The controller consisted a joystick module to take in data regarding the motion of the quadcopter and a radio module to communicate this data to the quadcopter. The code for the controller and quadcopter were written in C++ using the Visual Studio Code editor and uploaded to the boards using the command-line interface. The quadcopter shell was designed using OnShape CAD software.
